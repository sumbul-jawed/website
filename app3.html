       <h1><i> <u> <font color="blue">What is TypeScript?</font></h1></i></u>
       <p>TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds <strong> static typing.</strong> <br>
        
        This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add <strong>types</strong> . <br>

        TypeScript being a <strong> "Syntactic Superset"</strong> means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
     </p>

    <h1> <u> <i> <font color="red"> Why should I use TypeScript? </font> </i> </u> </h1>
<p> 
    
    JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript. <br>
    
    In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation. <br>

    
    TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match. <br>

    
    For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not. <br>

    
    TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match <strong>before</strong>  running the code, not <strong>while</strong> running the code.

<h1> <u> <i> <font color="peach"> How do I use TypeScript? </font> </i> </u> </h1> 

<p>
    
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript. <br>

The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project. <br>

Some popular code editors, such as <strong> Visual Studio Code,</strong> have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code! <br>
